Simulated custom network topologies in Mininet to analyze the bufferbloat phenomenon.
Generated network traffic using iPerf to study the impact of router queue sizes and TCP congestion control algorithms (e.g., Reno).
Monitored key metrics like congestion window, queue lengths, and RTT using tools such as tcpprobe.
Derived models to quantify the effects of excessive buffering on latency and throughput.
Gained practical insights into network simulation, traffic generation, and congestion management applicable to real-world networks.
